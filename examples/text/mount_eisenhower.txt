Mount Eisenhower (formerly Mount Pleasant) is a mountain in the Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire approximately 4,760 ft (1,450 m) high.  Named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, its summit offers a 360Â° view of New Hampshire's mountains. It is inaccessible by road.
The Crawford Path, carrying the Appalachian Trail, crosses the mountain near its summit. It separates from the summit loop trail at 4,400 feet (1,300 m), 0.3 mi (0.5 km) south of the summit, and rejoins it 0.3 mi (0.5 km) northeast of the summit, having made a net elevation gain of about 40 feet (12 m) and reached a maximum on Eisenhower of about 4,520 feet (1,380 m).
The shortest trail route to the summit of Eisenhower is from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, to its west-northwest, via primarily the Edmands Path. Several routes are available from points more or less southwest of it on Route 302; the most used of these (probably roughly equal in popularity to the Edmands route) is via the Crawford Path, starting from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, very near 302 and just north of the Highland Center in the Crawford Notch area.  Mount Monroe lies on the ridge northeast of Mt. Eisenhower, and Mount Pierce to the southwest. All three of these peaks are included on the peak-bagging list of four-thousand footers in New Hampshire.  Mount Franklin, an "unofficial" peak (not prominent enough to be included in the list), lies between Mount Eisenhower and Mount Monroe.
